## Vision
Sermant is a proxyless service mesh based on Java bytecode enhancement technology. It utilizes Java bytecode enhancement to provide service governance capabilities to applications, addressing service governance issues in large-scale microservices architectures. Sermant's vision also includes building a plugin development ecosystem to assist developers in more easily creating service governance functionalities without interfering with the application's source code.
